Arranged as created.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
MAIN GUI:
		EELS_IntroPage:
					desktop (root) : contains all data. Stored as local variables si, zlp, dump
							SI : contains info about spectrum image.
									filename

									dir

									DM3import: structure returned by DM3 Import Function

									SIcell: contains a cell where each element is a 2 column array containing (x,y) values for the spectrum.

									processedSIcell: a cell similar to SIcell, after a sequence of operations (as recorded in the variable Dump.txt)

									DrudeFitCell: contains a two dimensional array, in which each element corresponds to the Fit object to a Drude model.

									DrudeGofCell: contains a two dimensional array with each element containing the goodness of fit for the EELS spectrum at that position, to a Drude Model.

									LorentzFitCell: contains a two dimensional array, in which each element corresponds to the Fit object to a Lorentz peak.

									LorentzGofCell: contains a two dimensional array with each element containing the goodness of fit for the EELS spectrum at that position, to a Lorentz peak.

							ZLP : contains info about zero loss peak.
